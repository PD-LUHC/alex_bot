  area_type = "lad",

\arguments{
\item{area_type}{Character scalar, one of
\code{"lad"}, \code{"ctyua"}, \code{"msoa"}, \code{"pcon"}.
These correspond to:
\itemize{
\item \code{"lad"} = Local Authority District
\item \code{"ctyua"} = Counties and Unitary Authority
\item \code{"msoa"} = Middle Layer Super Output Area
\item \code{"pcon"} = Parliamentary Constituency
}
Default is \code{"lad"}.}

\item{resolution}{Character scalar passed to \code{ons_get_boundaries()} to
choose the boundary generalisation. Defaults to \code{"BGC"}.}

\item{nations}{Named logical vector of length 4 defining which nations to
include when downloading boundaries; names must be \code{c("E","N","S","W")}.
The default is \code{c(E = TRUE, N = FALSE, S = FALSE, W = FALSE)}.}

\item{random_seed}{Integer or \code{NULL}. If supplied, sets the RNG seed
at the start of the round to ensure reproducibility of the selected area
and the generated options. If \code{NULL} (default), each run is random.}

\item{hint_mode}{Character scalar; how to generate hint distances. One of:
\code{"proportional"} (default) or \code{"fixed_km"}.
\itemize{
\item \code{"proportional"}: distances are computed as
\code{buffer_scales * unit_km}, where \code{unit_km} depends on
\code{buffer_basis} (see below) and is floored at \code{min_buffer_km}.
\item \code{"fixed_km"}: distances are taken directly from
\code{buffers_km}.
}}

\item{buffers_km}{Numeric vector of hint distances in kilometres used only
when \code{hint_mode == "fixed_km"}. Default: \code{c(15, 30, 60)}.}

\item{buffer_scales}{Numeric vector of multipliers used only when
\code{hint_mode == "proportional"}. Default: \code{c(1, 2.5, 5)}.}

\item{buffer_basis}{Character scalar defining the basis for proportional
hints; one of \code{"maxdim"}, \code{"diag"}, \code{"area_radius"}.
This is passed to \code{.la_size_unit_km()} to compute \code{unit_km}.}

\item{min_buffer_km}{Numeric scalar. Minimum hint distance (km) applied
when using proportional hints so that very small areas still get a
sensible first hint. Default: \code{5}.}

\item{n_options}{Integer scalar. Total number of answer options to show
when the user types \code{"options"}. One is correct; the rest are
distractors. Default: \code{4}.}

\item{options_radius_km}{Numeric scalar. Maximum distance (km) from the
target within which distractor options are sampled. Default: \code{60}.}
}
\description{
Launch an interactive terminal game that asks the user to guess a UK
geography (e.g., Local Authority District, MSOA) selected at random.
The game downloads ONS boundaries for the chosen \code{area_type}, shows an
initial map, and then responds to user commands (\code{hint}, \code{options},
\code{reveal}, \code{quit}) until the round ends.

\section{How it works}{

\itemize{
\item Downloads boundaries via \code{ons_get_boundaries()} for the given
\code{area_type}, \code{resolution}, and \code{nations}.
\item Randomly selects a target and opens a plot of the selected area.
\item Provides progressive \strong{hints} either at fixed distances
(\code{hint_mode = "fixed_km"}) or distances \emph{proportional}
to the size of the area (\code{hint_mode = "proportional"}), where
proportional distances are computed from \code{buffer_basis}.
\item Offers multiple-choice \strong{options} drawn from nearby areas.
